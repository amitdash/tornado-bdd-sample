# lettuce + sure + selenium + tornado

# What

a simple web application written with outside-in BDD technique through Lettuce + Sure + Selenium 2 + firefox

# requirements

* [selenium 2](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium/) which provides firefox "native" support
* [sure](http://github.com/gabrielfalcao/sure)
* [lettuce](http://github.com/gabrielfalcao/lettuce)
* [tornado](http://tornadoweb.org/)
* [fabric](http://fabfile.org/)
* [daemon](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-daemon/)

## install them all in a single shot!

    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

# running the tests

just go to the directory and run the command:

    fab test

# running the server

just go to the directory and run the command:

    python sample/start.py

## run as daemon

    python sample/start.py --daemon

## run in different ports (specially for [deployment in production](http://www.tornadoweb.org/documentation#running-tornado-in-production))

    python sample/start.py --port=8000

### more on daemon mode

all the parameters below are optional, if you don't set someone it
will default to the application path

#### setting the working directory

    python sample/start.py --daemon --working-directory=/path/to/working/dir/



#### setting the pidfile directory

    python sample/start.py --daemon --pidfile-directory=/var/run/ --port=8899

this will make the server run on `/var/run/tornado-8899.lock`

## putting all together

this will run your application as daemon in ports 8000 to 8003 working on `/srv/apps/tornado-app`:

    python sample/start.py --port=8000 --daemon --pidfile-directory=/var/run/ --working-directory=/srv/apps/tornado-app
    python sample/start.py --port=8001 --daemon --pidfile-directory=/var/run/ --working-directory=/srv/apps/tornado-app
    python sample/start.py --port=8002 --daemon --pidfile-directory=/var/run/ --working-directory=/srv/apps/tornado-app
    python sample/start.py --port=8003 --daemon --pidfile-directory=/var/run/ --working-directory=/srv/apps/tornado-app

and the pidfiles will be located at:

`/var/run/tornado-8000.lock`
`/var/run/tornado-8001.lock`
`/var/run/tornado-8002.lock`
`/var/run/tornado-8003.lock`

# in production

this app was made to run on [Amazon EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) with [monit](http://mmonit.com/monit/) on it

you can set your monit to run the following script located at this project's root folder:

    ./deploy/server start 8000
    ./deploy/server start 8001
    ./deploy/server start 8002
    ./deploy/server start 8003

and stop them with

    ./deploy/server stop 8000
    ./deploy/server stop 8001
    ./deploy/server stop 8002
    ./deploy/server stop 8003
